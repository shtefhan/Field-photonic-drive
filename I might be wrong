I think the field photonic drive may not work.

A solution  to not brake the third law of motion was pointed out in a comment,
that I can balance out the momentum by adding that a photon while travelling in a medium,
the extra momentum that is gained is balanced out by momentum impaired on the medium. 
So when a photon enters a medium, the medium is pulled against the direction of travel of the photon,
and when it exits is pushed with the direction of travel. Now everything is in balance,
the total momentum of the system, the radiation pressure, and the photon momentum.

This is most likely be the thing that will happen, but to know for sure is to build it.
